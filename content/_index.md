    tagline: What's modern about waiting for you site to build? With Hugo, you don't have to.
    copy: Jettison expensive runtime dependencies, and let Go’s incomparable I/O primitives do the work for you. For the first time, build your sites in micro- and milliseconds. At less than .7 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

  - heading: Markdown Without Limits
    tagline: Write your content how you want to.
    copy: Hugo natively supports Github Flavored Markdown, as well as Asciidoc, reStructuredText, and Org-mode through external helpers. Write your front matter in YAML, JSON, or TOML; whichever works best for you.

  - heading: Shortcodes
    tagline: Shortcodes are Markdown's hidden super power. Hugo has them, and you can even write your own.

    copy: Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions.
