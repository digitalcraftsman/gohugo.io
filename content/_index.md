    tagline: Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream.
    copy: Hugo offers support for taxonomies, unlimited content types, DRY templating, URL management, menus, archetypes, and summaries, all without the need for plugins. Need dynamic, API-driven content? That's baked in too.

  - heading: Shortcodes
    tagline: Shortcodes are Markdown's hidden super power. Hugo has them, and you can even write your own.
